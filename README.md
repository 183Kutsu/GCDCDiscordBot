# GCDCDiscordBot
Grand Chase Dimensional Chaser Discord Bot

## Instructions
Install Python 2.7  or 3.7
Install Anaconda
Install Scrapy via Conda terminal

Run the node.js when you need to have the bot active
```
- Navigate to the working folder
- run node "bot.js", without the quotes in the commandline.
```

Run scrapy crawl when data or new data is needed

## Notes
- It's highly recommended now-a-days to install Anaconda in order to install Scrapy. You can install it via Python however it's known to have issues even when MS C++ 14.0 is installed on your machine.
- Install and run this on a virtual environment. "We do not like crap where we eat"
